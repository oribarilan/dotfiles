# MacOS Setup Guide

## Set up nvim as an app

1. Follow instructions in `/misc/nvim_automator.sh` to create an Automator app that launches nvim in terminal (and also open files using nvim directly).
2. Set `/misc/neovim-hicontrast.icns` as the icon for the app (Get Info -> Highlight the small icon -> Paste the .icns file)

## Set up alternation between windows of the same app

1. Open System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Keyboard Shortcuts -> Keyboard -> "Move focus to the next window"
2. Set a shortcut (e.g., hyper + 'a')
